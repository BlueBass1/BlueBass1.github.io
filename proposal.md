# Proposal

I want to make a linkable portfolio

## Project Description and Motivation:

I am making a portfolio page. The reason I'm making this is to display what I learned from Base Camp. I want his page to be a quick source for people to go look at for a summary of skills and experiences.

## Prior Art:

I have taken inspiration from multiple different portfolio pages made by previous Base Camp students. To name a few, Gillian Floyd for her simple and sleek design, Cole Anderson for his use of page transitions, and Ali Spittel for how she shows personality and keeps things simple and concise for the user.

## Core User Workflows:

I will be building a portfolio page so that employers and those who are curious about my work will be able to conveniently reference off of it. I plan on the user to be able to check out the projects I have listed by adding links via the images.

## Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals:

Tuesday: I plan on having the HTML completely set up and have everything I implemented functional. If I'm already at this step then I will focus on working on my CSS and the general design of the site.

Wednesday: I want to work on the design if I have not already finished experimenting with it. By the end of the day, I want my portfolio to be sectioned properly and fully designed so that I can receive feedback.

Thursday: This is the day I want to focus on cleaning up as much as possible so that if I want to change anything, I can make the changes without stressing my time on the project.
