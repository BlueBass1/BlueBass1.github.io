    My name is Jeremiah Bass, I’m a student at Base Camp Coding Academy
    located in Water Valley, Mississippi. I am currently training in Python,

    <p>    
        <h3>Accomplishments:</h3>
        I have learned the fundamentals of Python. I am a homeschooled student who has graduated with honors through sources like CHEC, where I was accepted into the National Beta Club. I enrolled in and passed College Algebra with a high A while being dual enrolled in North West Community College and high school.
        <h3>Values and Passions:</h3>
        I value the connections I make with others, and I believe that everyone should be allowed to be themselves as long as they don’t harm others and themselves. I am passionate about gaming and different aspects of music and art. I also enjoy learning about game-design, philosophy, psychology, and different forms of artistic media and what goes into them.
        <h3>Superpowers:</h3>
        I’m good at working with what I’m given. I have an excellent acumen toward flexibility and high adaptability in multi-tasking. I am also capable of learning new concepts quickly when I can experiment with them.
        <h3>Differentiation:</h3>
        I was a homeschooled student throughout all of my education life. I did, however, take extra courses outside of just being homeschooled.
        <h3>Validation:</h3>
        I have succeeded in classes outside of homeschooling such as the Collage Algebra Course I took at NWCC. I did community service with the YMCA and the B.J.Chain Public Library, located in Olive Branch, MS. I have also completed two years in a structured Spanish class while completing my home school education.
